# BackendProject & Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application consisting of a backend API and a frontend dashboard. The backend is developed with PHP and follows an MVC structure, handling data management, business logic, and file uploads. The frontend is built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, providing a responsive and interactive user interface for managing content, users, and submissions.

## Features

### Backend
- RESTful API endpoints for managing blog posts, users, and submissions.
- MVC architecture for better code organization and maintainability.
- File upload and management functionality for images and other assets.
- Secure handling of requests and input validation.

### Frontend (Dashboard)
- Responsive admin dashboard using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS.
- Pages include Home, Sign Up, Login, Users, Projects, and Settings.
- Dynamic forms and real-time data display.
- Light/Dark mode support.
- Interactive UI components and client-side validations.
